# Fully_body_VSM: Teaching Robots to Build Simulations of Themselves

Fully_body_VSM is a cutting-edge project aimed at enabling robots to understand and predict their own physical presence in the world through simulations. By leveraging deep learning models, our system teaches robots to build accurate simulations of themselves, enhancing their ability to interact with and navigate their environment. This repository contains the necessary code and models to set up and run simulations of robot body predictions in real-time using the Pybullet simulation environment.

## Environment Setup

To run the Fully_body_VSM project, you need to have Python 3.9 installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, we recommend downloading it from the official Python website or using a package manager like Homebrew for macOS, apt for Ubuntu, or Chocolatey for Windows.

### Dependencies

Once Python is installed, you will need to install the project dependencies. Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the cloned directory, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
